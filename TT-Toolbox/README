TT-Toolbox (TT=Tensor Train) Version 2.2

TT(Tensor Train) format is an efficient way for low-parametric
representation of high-dimensional tensors. The TT-Toolbox
is a MATLAB implementation of basic operations with 
tensors in TT-format. It includes: 

    * tt_tensor and tt_matrix classes for storing vectors and operators
    * Basic linear algebra subroutines (addition, matrix-by-vector product, 
    elementwise multiplication and many others) using standard MATLAB syntax, 
    linear complexity in the dimension, reshape function
    * Fast rounding procedure with a prescribed accuracy
    * Advanced approximation and solution techniques:
        * Approximate solution of linear systems and eigenvalue problems 
        * Cross methods to approximate ``black-box'' tensors
        * Wavelet tensor train decomposition
    * Construction of basic operators and functions (Laplace operator, function of a TT-tensor)
    * Computation of maximal and minimal elements of a tensor
    * and several others

New in Version 2.2
    * Better documentation
    * Mixed QTT-Tucker format (qtt_tucker class)
    * reshape function for a TT-tensor/TT-matrix
    * dmrg_cross method for black-box tensor approximation
    * Convolution in QTT-format
